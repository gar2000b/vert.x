/*	Verticle Types
	There are three different types of verticles:

	Standard Verticles
	These are the most common and useful type - they are always executed 
	using an event loop thread. Weâ€™ll discuss this more in the next section.

	Worker Verticles
	These run using a thread from the worker pool. An instance is never 
	executed concurrently by more than one thread.

	Multi-threaded worker verticles
	These run using a thread from the worker pool. An instance can be 
	executed concurrently by more than one thread. */
